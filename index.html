<p>Hello, and welcome to my portfolio! I'm Nicholas Mulrooney, aspiring software engineer and developer, and this is
where I host my exploits in multimedia. These four projects are the fruits of many hours of toil in a Multimedia course
hosted by Otago Polytechnic's Bachelor of Information Technology.</p>

<h2><a href="ui.html">User Interface</a></h2>
<p>A project to design the user interface for a relatively simple application. Done entirely in
Adobe Illustrator, although this unit also included basic training in Photoshop. This project 
tested my ability to make informed decisions about an application's layout and appearance,
so as to create the ideal user experience.</p>

<h2><a href="video.html">Video</a></h2>
<p>For this project, we shot and edited a short film in groups of 1-3. I collaborated with Michael
Lagocki and Joshua Sim on planning and shooting this film, before we splintered off to edit it individually.
I used Adobe Premiere for my edit. The goal of this project was to demonstrate a clear understanding of all three aspects of the
film-making process: pre-production, production, and post-production.</p>

<h2><a href="animation.html">Animation</a></h2>
<p>A 30-second long animation telling a short story. I drew and animated this entirely in Adobe
Animate</p>

<h2><a href="#">This Portfolio</a></h2>
<p>I built this website from scratch in HTML and CSS, in order to display both my deliverables (in the form of various images
and links) and my documentation (in the form of text and many more images). It is currently hosted on Gitlab Pages, where it will
probably remain.
