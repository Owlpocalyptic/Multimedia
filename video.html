		<h2>Development</h2>
		<h3>Research</h3>
		<p>We settled on a car review very early in the month, based on Michael and Joshua's mutual interest in cars and the relative ease with
		which we could procure one. To get caught up on the car review game, I looked through a couple of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCo1pShh6dtg-T_ZZkgi_JDQ">car review</a> 
		<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTSQgaRasnc">Youtube channels</a> that they recommended, and also
		had a look at perhaps a better-produced option in <em>Top Gear</em> (which isn't exactly a car review show but does serve a similar purpose of demonstrating cars
		and their capabilities).</p>
		<p>The main features of a car review are fairly simple, and perhaps even obvious. First, you have to show viewers the car. This usually
		consists of a few wide shots from varying angles, to give a sense of the car as a whole, and a large number of close ups, medium close ups, and extreme close ups on
		the car's smaller features. These close shots are often accompanied by audio that briefly names the model and specs of each part shown-- sometimes a voiceover, and 
		sometimes spoken by an actor directly on film. (I noticed that the actor was more commonly used in the Top Gear material, presumably because they had access to professional
		actors and onsite recording equipment.) The cuts between these shots are generally simple and functional jump cuts, although a more theatrical crossfade or transition
		is sometimes used when it's finally time to show the car in action.</p>
		<p>Second, you have to come to some conclusion about the car. I mostly left this part to Michael and Josh, since I'm not very well versed in cars
		and their merits. Luckily (I guess), about the most interesting thing you can say about the Toyota Corolla is that it is just a car, which is
		about the level of analysis that I can work with.</p>
		<h3>Pre-production: Script</h3>
		<p>As a team, we tried to keep to the format and conventions of a standard screenplay. Our video was just an ordinary product review,
		so we didn't need to put enormous amounts of thought into conveying a coherent narrative or anything like that. We did initially
		debate putting some humour into the script, but we excised most of it by the final draft amid concerns of the jokes falling flat.</p>
		<p>Our script mostly existed as a way to key visuals to the voiceover that we knew we were going to record, so it included
		some elements that weren't strictly scriptworthy, like pre-existing stills of a second car that wasn't part of the review. This
		was more to remind ourselves that we didn't need to film those parts more than anything. I imagine that a more professional workflow
		would have left these considerations for the shot list to handle.</p>

		<h3>Pre-production: Storyboard</h3>
		<p>PLACEHOLDER TEXT</p>
		<h3>Pre-production: Shot List & Schedule</h3>
		<p>This part is where I started to apply the lessons we'd learned from our practice run filming the BIT ad. When we entered post-production
		for the ad, I quickly noticed that we hadn't taken nearly enough transitional shots, despite decent coverage for more action-packed shots. To avoid
		running into the same problem again, I made sure that <em>this</em> list included many more shots of the car going to places, and more panning shots to
		give us something to use to provide cohesion of movement between scenes.</p>
		<p>You can find our shot list in <a href="docs/Shot-List.pdf">this PDF</a>. Unfortunately we weren't able to recover our shooting schedule
		from CeltX before we lost access to our trial, but I have reconstructed it here:</p>
		<table>
			<tr><th>Interior Shots</th><td>Various close-ups and extreme close-ups on important car parts like the steering wheel and gearstick.</td></tr>
			<tr><th>Exterior Shots</th><td>Medium and wide shots of the car itself from outside, including what it looks like with the doors, boot and bonnet open. Some close-ups of parts like the tires and engine.</td></tr>
			<tr><th>Driving Shots A</th><td>Varying shots of the car moving through the parking lot where the last two sets of shots were taken.</td></tr>
			<tr><th>Driving Shots B</th><td>Wide shots of the car as it travels along roads, taken from the back of a second car.</td></tr>
		</table>
		<p>The main line of thought here was to do all of our shots that required a specific location (in this case the parking lot) at that location, before
		going on to shots around town. We started with the interior shots because we had stopped the car anyway, then moved on to exterior shots that we wanted the car to be still for,
		then moved on to the shots of the car moving through the parking lot, and then finished off with the shots of the
		car driving around town once we left the parking lot. </p>
		<h3>Pre-production: Everything Else</h3>
		<p>Once we had our script and shooting plans set out, we just had to arrange all of our props and filming equipment. Most of our equipment
		were devices that we usually travelled with anyway-- our phones and Michael and Josh's cars. The extra stuff we readied were a Go-Pro camera,
		and double-sided tape to stick it to the various surfaces we were going to stick it to (mostly Michael's headband).</p>
		<h3>Production: Filming</h3>
		<p>In execution our plan worked basically as well as we could have hoped, although we did come up with a couple of
		new interior shots after we started working on the exterior shots section. We used three phones and a single Go-Pro as our cameras. After filming,
		Michael used a microphone attached to his computer to record his narration.</p>
		<p>We did face a couple of challenges regarding our Go-Pro shots-- our initial setup of having the Go-Pro on Michael's forehead resulted in the ceiling of Michael's car taking up the entire
		top half of the shot, producing quite a claustrophobic feeling in the resulting footage. Our second attempt stacked up better... but once we pooled our footage, it transpired that
		the Go-Pro had been set to photo mode at some point between the two attempts, meaning that we recorded no actual footage from the second run.</p>
		<p>Fortunately, our extensive coverage during the Driving Shots segments of our shot plan meant that we could absorb this loss quite safely.</p>
		<h3>Post-Production: Media Management</h3>
		<p>Our footage was initially split across three phones and one Go-Pro: to consolidate it, we agreed to upload everything to a shared
		Google Drive. This marks the end of our collaboration: from this point onwards, we split off to edit the video separately.</p>
		<p>I used Adobe Premiere for my edit, because I've used it before and it's the program available on
		the machines here at the BIT.</p>

				<a href="img/struggles7.png"><img src="img/struggles7.png"></img></a>
			</div>
		</div>
		<p>My first move was to name every file according to its contents. I used the tag in brackets to denote the "topic" of the shot in a general sense;
		"int" for shots of the interior of the car, "ext" to shots of the car's exterior, and "driving" to shots of the car as it moved. As
		pictured, I also used an [audio] tag to denote when a file was simply audio. The first word after the tag indicated the movement of the shot, where applicable--
		as I was editing the BIT ad video, I noticed that I was more interested in how the camera was moving around its subject than the subject itself,
		since the subject was almost always the robot. This transferred over to our car video, where the subject was almost always the car. The next word described the specific subject, which in this case was usually the part of the car that the shot
		showed. Finally, I included a number, indicating the chronological order in which shots of matching categories were taken. The first panning shot of the car's rear
		would be "[ext] panning rear 1.mp4", and so on.</p>
		<p>Afterwards, I created a new project in Premiere and organised all the media into bins based on their tag. Thanks to the magic
		of "Sort by name" (to order them by tag) and shift-clicking, I was able to do this quite quickly.</p>
		<h3>Post-Production: Rough Cut</h3>
		<p>This was pretty straightforward. Although I tried to avoid fine-tuning clips as much as I could, the difference in aspect ratio between
		the film footage and the project's footage made Adobe Premiere rescale and crop off parts of the clips that I added to my timeline, forcing me to
		edit the effects to make sure that the clips I added were indeed suited to the job.</p>
		<h3>Post-Production: Fine Edits</h3>
		<p>I didn't do anything too crazy with special effects or title cards. My main concern was cutting at appropriate points in the voiceover (usually
		when it named a new car part or on the pauses between clauses, to keep the video from getting visually stale). I used keyframes a couple of times:
		first to pan across a still image of the car's engine (the footage we had taken was too shaky for my tastes), and then at the end to crossfade into
		the credits.
		<div class="imgrowwrapper">
			<img src="img/struggles8.png"></img>
		</div>
		<h3>Post-Production: Sound Editing</h3>
		<p>I had three sound files to edit: the voiceover that runs for most of the duration of the film, the sound of the engine revving at a specific point in the film, and
		the music that plays over the end credits.</p>
		<p>The voiceover I kept at a conversational -9.0 decibels, reflecting the usual standards. I reduced the music to -12.0 decibels, keeping it muted and soft since
		it was the last thing that the viewer would hear. I made sure to take a suitably low-energy clip of the song too, so that it didn't give
		viewers the false impression that it was building to something.</p>
		<p>My plan for the engine revving had initially been to take it down to -6.0 decibels, about the same volume as I would leave yelling, but
		it proved too loud even after this modification to the clip's audio. After adjusting it down to -9.0 it sounded alright, though: noticeably
		louder than the voiceover, but not so loud as to be painful or grating.</p>
		<h3>Post-Production: Colour Grading</h3>
		<p>In general the shots taken from phone cameras were a little too dark: I enhanced the exposure slightly and fine tuned the balance of
		highlights and shadows with the appropriate sliders.</p>
		<div class="imgrowwrapper">
			<div class="imgrow">
				<img src="img/struggles11-a.png"></img>
			</div>
			<div class="imgrow">
			<img src="img/struggles11-b.png"></img>
			</div>
		</div>
		<p>Since the deep blue of the car generally resisted any natural changes to hue, I didn't have to pay too much attention to the overall hue of the image, 
		except to keep things consistent between shots.</p>
		<p>One major issue I had was dealing with the aberrant exposure on the first half of this shot of Michael pulling the gearstick. As you can see on the
		Lumascope display on the right of this screenshot, Michael's arm is extremely bright compared to the rest of the image.</p>
		<div class="imgrowwrapper">
			<div class="imgrow">
				<img src="img/struggles12-a.png"></img>
			</div>
			<div class="imgrow">
				<img src="img/struggles12-b.png"></img>
			</div>
		</div>
		<p>I tried to normalize the image's brightness somewhat. First I brought up the brightness of highlights, then I tried to 
		enhance the brightness of the shadows, and then I reduced the contrast of the image. Whether I did them individually or combined them, these measures resulted in weird
		overexposed looks that still didn't address the core issue of the hand being way too bright. I eventually gave up and removed that section
		of the clip entirely-- the second half of the shot only needed minor tweaks, and still conveyed the same idea of pulling a gearstick to cue
		the engine revving.</p>
		<p>The other important decision I made at this stage was keyframing some of the corrections, mostly in clips where the light level
		changed drastically as the camera ran. The clip of Michael's hand above would have fallen under this category if I had kept the bright part
		of it.</p>
		<div class="imgrowwrapper">
			<img src="img/struggles13.png"></img>
		</div>
		<p>Generally, I set up the first keyframe at about the time I wanted the transition to start (i.e. when the light started to change), the
		second at the point at which the difference from the first keyframe was the most stark, and then sometimes a third at the end of the clip, if
		the light changed a second time. Some of the clips required several microadjusments in between these "key" keyframes, such as the example above, which was of the
		interior of the car's boot.</p>
		<h3>Exporting and Deployment</h3>
		<p>I looked up an <a href="https://whoismatt.com/hdexportsettings/">online guide</a> for exporting into the format that best fit Youtube, since I hadn't done it
		in a while. The results speak for themselves, hopefully. In order to keep Michael's license plate from getting leaked online, I made sure to set the video
		to "unlisted" rather than "public".</p>
