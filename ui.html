			<h2>Development</h2>
			<h3>Planning and Research</h3>
			<p>To begin with, I thought about what the main purpose of my application would be. 
			   It was meant to relay information about certain key, important dates to its user,
			   without forcing them to have to perform a bunch of mental calculations to work out
			   what those numerical dates translate to in <em>real world</em> days.</p>
			<p>It seemed like a good start to research existing applications that deal with portraying
			   days (and the events that fall on them) in an easy-to-digest manner.</p>

			<p>As I'd suspected, there were a few key shared elements between these applications.</p>
			<p>First was the sparing use of colour. It is reserved for two key purposes: first,
			   establishing the application's brand, and second, visually distinguishing key dates
			   from each other. Where possible, users are allowed to select these "labelling"
			   colours themselves. A colour that someone chooses themselves is one that's easier 
			   for them to recognize later on down the line.</p>
			<p>The other main similarity was how visually similar each individual day is. If one
			   day is a monochromatic stripe and some words in a box, they all are. This helps
			   to reinforce that any date is generally interchangeable with another. The functionality 
			   (the user is able to assign events any date they choose) is alluded to by the design.

			<p>With a basic direction to strive for, I encountered my first big decision: should
			   I have my navigation bar on the left of the screen, or across the top? I drew out
			   both possibilities to get a better sense of what it would look like.
			</p>
			<p>Once I'd finished, it occurred to me that I could have the navigation bar change places
			   based on which position best fit the content at the time-- across the top in the timetable
			   view, then moving to the side when the user wanted to look at an individual day. However,
			   the idea didn't pan out: it felt very strange to have the bar move between views, to the
			   point that would have detracted from the visual experience of navigating through the application.
			</p>
			<p>Ultimately, I chose to put the navigation bar across the top of the application.
			   This favoured the timetable view over the single day view, which suited the
			   implicit hierarchy between the two. The needs of many outweigh the few, to grossly
			   misuse a theory of ethics so that I can justify my design choices.
			</p>
			<h3>Process: General</h3>
			<p>Next, I had to pick an application. For my purposes the choice was between Photoshop and
			   Illustrator, since I don't have much experience with any of the other viable options. I picked
			   Illustrator mostly because I'd used it to build a wireframe before, and I find it more intuitive
			   to work with Illustrator's versions of the shape tools (especially when it comes to modifying paths).
			</p>
			<p>With that out of the way, I decided to produce all of the wireframes and mockups in a single Adobe Illustrator document, 
			   to make copying and pasting between views as simple painless as possible. Each view was 
			   placed on its own artboard.
			</p>

					</div>
			</div>
			<p>My layer structure consisted of two master layers, the "mockup" and "wireframe" layers, both 
			   with a large number of sublayers to hold all the elements. This allowed me to easily hide and
			   reveal either layer at a time so that I could get a better look at what I was doing, and made 
			   it easy to export all of my deliverables once I was finished.
			</p>
			<h3>Process: Wireframes</h3>
			<p>During this step I mostly thought about alignment and spacing. My main concern was giving the
			   elements enough padding to avoid making them feel claustrophobic for the user. One little thing
			   I did that I thought was neat was making sure that the content of all five views was either significantly
			   narrower or wider than the space taken up by the buttons on the navigation bar.
			</p>
			<img src="img/struggles3.png"></img>
			<p>This was to subtly hint to the user that the two interfaces, while part of the same application,
			   have very different goals from one another. The navigation bar is used to navigation between slices
			   of content, while the content is what the user is actually here for. Later I doubled down on this
			   by making the navigation bar completely blue.
			</p>
			<p>The other cool thing I did in the wireframing process was experiment a little with line. Most
			   of my attempts were ill-fitting, but one worked well enough to keep.
			</p>
			<img src="img/struggles9.png"></img>
			<p>This solitary diagonal line was quite striking against the sea of squares behind it, and it really
			   helped draw the eye from the left to the main point of interest-- the in-depth look at the course
			   on the right. Like the navigation bar, I did wind up having to reinforce this effect
			   with colour co-ordination once I got to the mockup phase.
			</p>
			<h3>Process: Mockups</h3>
			<p>This was the fun part, where I looked mainly at colour and font.
			</p>
			<p>For colour, I wanted my application to be quite cool and easy to look at, especially since most use cases involve <em>regular</em> use. I'd heard that blue is generally the colour that the better-performing social media platforms favour, so I gave that a shot, and it worked well enough. Blue also has the advantage of being one of the easier colours to co-ordinate other colours with, since it can go with almost any other colour that exists.
			</p>
			<p>With blue locked in, I had to settle on shade. It made sense to me to take this opportunity to further distinguish thead
			   navigation bar from the application's actual content, so I went for quite a dark shade-- dark enough that the text would
			   have to be white to be legible. This created an immediate dichotomy in the text itself: white words for navigation, black
			   words for information.
			</p>
			<p>My font choice was largely a happy accident. It's a solid, legible, sans-serif font that fits nicely with my minimalist
			   design sensibilities, so I stuck with it. The only place I didn't use it in were the text boxes, since those almost always
			   use the default Arial and I had no reason to change that.
			</p>
			<p>One big thing I changed between my mockups and my wireframes was rounding out almost all of my rectangles. I found that this
			   supported the clean, modern look that I was going for and helped to make the borders around most of my "course boxes" look
			   a little less loud and aggressive (especially since I used such bright colours to help them stand out from their desaturated
			   backgrounds).
			</p>
			<img src="img/pride.png"></img>
			<p>This little time-slot selection interface is one thing that I think turned out really well. The spacing between the individual
			   slots communicates a wealth of information about what they're even supposed to be without using any words at all: it greatly
			   resembles the structure of the time table on the home page, down to the larger gap down the middle of the table to represent
			   lunchtime.
			</p>
			<p>Anyway, that's about everything. Hope you liked it!</p>
