            <h3>Getting Comfortable</h3>
            <p>Unlike the other Adobe products that come packaged with drawing tools, Adobe Animate
               adds the dimension of time to the standard X and Y axes of two-dimensional art. This
               leads directly to some of the more unusual features of Adobe Animate, like the insistence
               of each drawing tool on creating complete "shapes" rather than letting each line sit individually,
               or the importance of converting largely uninteractive shapes into symbols.
            </p>
            <p>Pictured above are .gif exports of a couple of my initial explorations into this
               new realm. The bouncing owl on the left is a first-blush attempt to combine the internal movement of
               a symbol with a tweening of that symbol on the project's main timeline, in order to
               create the illusion of realistic movement. The strange desert goblin on the right
               is an exploration into nesting symbols: the bobbing of his head and swinging of his
               arms is based on tweens contained entirely within the desert-man-symbol's internal
               timeline.
            </p>
            <h3>Settling On An Aesthetic</h3>
            <p>Initially I had been hoping to produce something a little more lavish than what I
               ultimately produced: the desert goblin .gif above was also an attempt to gauge how
               time-consuming it would be to use full backgrounds and decide on colour composition
               for each scene. Completing this minor scene, however, made me realize that this would
               be an inefficient investment. Drawing pretty backgrounds and filling everything with
               the right balance of colours doesn't express any particular mastery of animation itself, 
               so it wouldn't "pay for itself" in terms of the time it would take, at least for my 
               (limited) purposes.
            </p>
            <p>
               With this in mind, I decided to go in the other direction entirely, and use quite
               minimalist visuals so as to focus most of my attention on their <em>animation</em>.
               Of course, this didn't mean giving up on producing decent art entirely. It was more
               of a shift in perspective. In an inanimate medium, an artist can only ever get as far
               as implying motion-- but with the power of animation, a mediocre visual can be drastically
               enhanced by adding explicit motion to it.
            </p>
            <div class="imgrowwrapper">
                <img src="img/struggles 19.png"></img>
            </div>
            <p>For example, this shot from my final project is, in still form, just a hasty rendition
               of an unfortunate crash landing. But in the animation above, a simple motion tween is enough
               to breathe life and dynamism into this exact image. Both the physical motion and momentum,
               as well as the emotional component of the owl's dismal failure, are encoded in the shot's
               animation.
            </p>
            <h3>Storylines</h3>
            <p>With some technological aptitude and a basic look locked down, it was time to settle on
               a narrative. I decided to tell a story that didn't need any words at all, so that more of the
               onus of conveying a coherent narrative rested on my animating chops rather than my ability to words
               English good. I came up with this story about an owl getting hit on the head by an apple five or so 
               minutes after I started thinking of ideas. After that I came up with enough ideas for amusing visuals 
               to fill my animation with to feel confident about using this as my baseline.
            </p>
            <p>In the industry, I imagine that this process is rather more fraught than my experience, especially
               with large scale projects employing entire teams of professional scriptwriters, storyboarders and
               animators, and very little overlap between these groups. Even lone animators would have probably
               at least thumbnailed the idea before leaping straight into it. That said, I was working with limited
               resources in basically every single respect I can think of. I took what I could get.

            <h2>Production</h2>
            <h3>Tools Of The Trade</h3>
            <p>I used Adobe Animate to create my animation. It's available on all of the computers at the Polytechnic, and 
               it does happen to be the industry standard for web animation, so it was the clear choice. I drew all of the art
               assets I used myself, primarily using Animate's brush and pencil tools.
            </p>
            <p>When exporting the project, I decided to use HTML5-- .swf files are more inconvenient to run for most users, and I imagine
               that support for them will only be harder to come by as more and more of the Internet moves on to the animation format
               of the future.
            <h3>Asset Management</h3>
            <div class="imgrowwrapper">
                <div class="imgrow two">
                    <a href="img/struggles 14.png"><img src="img/struggles 14.png"></img></a>
                    <a href="img/struggles 17.png"><img src="img/struggles 17.png"></img></a>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>Adobe Animate features two main tools for managing assets. First is the library, which is where
               tweenable "symbols" are stored. I was able to use this feature to quickly and easily place additional instances
               of key objects into frames-- this was especially useful for the apple, which in a couple of scenes appeared
               multiple times at once. This feature was also a huge help in the couple of cases where I wanted to edit a symbol
               after I'd already placed multiple instances of it on the timeline: instead of having to manually update
               each instance on its own, I simply edited the "master copy" stored in the library, and my changes were reflected
               across every single instance of that symbol in my project.
            </p>
            <div class="imgrowwrapper">
                <a href="img/struggles 15.png"><img src="img/struggles 15.png"></img></a>
            </div>
            <p>The other tool is the same layer and folder system that Illustrator and Photoshop use. I used this tool to manage
               my "scenes" (which were more like individual shots than scenes), grouping each "scene's" layers up in their own folder so that
               the timeline interface wasn't cluttered with a million irrelevant layers. I named most of my scenes so that I had an idea of
               what their contents were.
            <h3>Visual Tricks</h3>
            <div class="imgrowwrapper">
                <div class="imgrow two">
                    <a href="img/struggles 16-a.png"><img src="img/struggles 16-a.png"></img></a>
                    <a href="img/struggles 16-b.png"><img src="img/struggles 16-b.png"></img></a>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>A couple of types of keyframe turned out to be surprisingly useful once I got to animating everything: in particular, the
               scale and alpha keyframes. By combining scale tweening with very small motion tweens, I found an extremely effective
               way to convey three-dimensional movement. The screenshots above show how I was able to use this to make this quite extreme
               shot, of an apple slowly descending upon an owl's head, more believable and suspenseful.
            </p>
            <div class="imgrowwrapper">
                <div class="imgrow two">
                    <a href="img/struggles 21-a.png"><img src="img/struggles 21-a.png"></img></a>
                    <a href="img/struggles 18.png"><img src="img/struggles 18.png"></img></a>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>Alpha tweening, on the other hand, is quite a versatile tool. I was able to use it to make changes in light level more realistic,
               by starting layers with shading or lighting on them at 0% alpha and then scaling that up to 100% a few frames later. I also used
               it in the shot on the right, to create a classic overdramatic slow-mo effect once the apple finally lands on the owl's head. I think my
               favourite use of it was in the extended flashback sequence at the end of the animation, when the owl finally exacts its vengeance.
               By combining the fade-in and fade-out of each "flashback" with simple pans across the screen, I was able to legibly evoke that trope
               (and convey the true depth of the owl's anguish and hatred) quite cheaply.
            </p>
            <div class="imgrowwrapper">
                <div class="imgrow two">
                    <a href="img/struggles 20-a.png"><img src="img/struggles 20-a.png"></img></a>
                    <a href="img/struggles 20-b.png"><img src="img/struggles 20-b.png"></img></a>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>Another little trick I pulled, outside of these exotic tweens, was in this shot of the apple bouncing over a tree root. As you
               can see, it starts out in front of the root, but then winds up "underneath" the layer of the tree itself. I created this effect
               with the select tool-- first I drew the entire tree, root and all, on a single layer as a single picture, so that they would attach
               together seamlessly. Then I selected the region of the root that I wanted the apple to appear "in front of", and ported it over to
               a separate layer on the timeline. Then I put the layer with the apple tween on it between these two layers, so that the apple would be
               on top of/in front of the root but underneath/behind the tree.
            </p>
            <h3>Cinematic Principles</h3>
            <p>Another way I tried to supplement my simple art style was by sticking to lessons we learned in the film unit. I mentioned
               shots and scenes earlier in this discussion: one of the fundamental laws of slotting together multiple shots from different
               angles is adhering to the line of action. If you want a scene to make visual sense, make sure that your characters
               stay on the same side of the line of action.
            </p>
            <div class="imgrowwrapper">
                <div class="imgrow two">
                    <a href="img/struggles 21-a.png"><img src="img/struggles 21-a.png"></img></a>
                    <a href="img/struggles 21-b.png"><img src="img/struggles 21-b.png"></img></a>
                </div>
                <div class="imgrow two">
                    <a href="img/struggles 21-c.png"><img src="img/struggles 21-c.png"></img></a>
                    <a href="img/struggles 21-d.png"><img src="img/struggles 21-d.png"></img></a>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>If I hadn't stuck to this rule for this last scene, it could have been very difficult to parse what was going on. A lot of
               different events were happening here: first the owl appeared over the apple, casting its shadow over it, and then it proceeded
               to dive bomb it, while remembering all the indignities that the apple had subjected it to. But by constantly keeping the owl on the
               left-hand side of the shot (and the apple on the right), and always having the owl and its shadow move <em>towards</em> the right,
               I was able to keep the narrative coherent and linear. Owl hates apple, owl moves towards it. When the owl finally did manage to cross
               over to the right side of the screen, it did so explicitly and on-screen, so that the viewer could easily follow the change in position.
            <p>
            <p>And that wraps it up! Hope you enjoyed this animation: it was definitely my favourite project so far.</p>
