            <h3>Getting Comfortable</h3>
            <p>Unlike the other Adobe products that come packaged with drawing tools, Adobe Animate
               adds the dimension of time to the standard X and Y axes of two-dimensional art. This
               leads directly to some of the more unusual features of Adobe Animate, like the insistence
               of each drawing tool on creating complete "shapes" rather than letting each line sit individually,
               or the importance of converting largely uninteractive shapes into symbols.
            </p>
            <p>Pictured above are .gif exports of a couple of my initial explorations into this
               new realm. The bouncing owl on the left is a first-blush attempt to combine the internal movement of
               a symbol with a tweening of that symbol on the project's main timeline, in order to
               create the illusion of realistic movement. The strange desert goblin on the right
               is an exploration into nesting symbols: the bobbing of his head and swinging of his
               arms is based on tweens contained entirely within the desert-man-symbol's internal
               timeline.
            </p>
            <h3>Settling On An Aesthetic</h3>
            <p>Initially I had been hoping to produce something a little more lavish than what I
               ultimately produced: the desert goblin .gif above was also an attempt to gauge how
               time-consuming it would be to use full backgrounds and decide on colour composition
               for each scene. Completing this minor scene, however, made me realize that this would
               be an inefficient investment. Drawing pretty backgrounds and filling everything with
               the right balance of colours doesn't express any particular mastery of animation itself, 
               so it wouldn't "pay for itself" in terms of the time it would take, at least for my 
               (limited) purposes.
            </p>
            <p>
               With this in mind, I decided to go in the other direction entirely, and use quite
               minimalist visuals so as to focus most of my attention on their <em>animation</em>.
               Of course, this didn't mean giving up on producing decent art entirely. It was more
               of a shift in perspective. In an inanimate medium, an artist can only ever get as far
               as implying motion-- but with the power of animation, a mediocre visual can be drastically
               enhanced by adding explicit motion to it.
            </p>
            <div class="imgrowwrapper">
                <img src="img/struggles 19.png"></img>
            </div>
            <p>For example, this still shot from my final project is, at most, a hasty rendition
               of an unfortunate crash landing. But in the animation above, a simple motion tween is enough
               to breathe life and dynamism into this exact image. Both the physical motion and momentum,
               as well as the emotional component of the owl's dismal failure, are encoded in the shot's
               animation.
            </p>
            <h3>Storylines</h3>
            <p>With some technological aptitude and a basic look locked down, it was time to settle on
               a narrative. I decided to tell a story that didn't need any words at all, so that more of the
               onus of conveying a coherent narrative rested on my animating chops rather than my ability to words
               English good. I came up with this story about an owl getting hit on the head by an apple five or so 
               minutes after I started thinking of ideas. After that I came up with enough ideas for amusing visuals 
               to fill my animation with to feel confident about using this as my baseline.
            </p>
            <p>In the industry, I imagine that this process is rather more fraught than my experience, especially
               with large scale projects employing entire teams of professional scriptwriters, storyboarders and
               animators, and very little overlap between these groups. Even lone animators would have probably
               at least thumbnailed the idea before leaping straight into it. That said, I was working with limited
               resources in basically every single respect I can think of. I took what I could get.
